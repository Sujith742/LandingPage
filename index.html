        <h2>UDACITY</h2>
        <P>
          Udacity is the outgrowth of free computer science classes offered
           in 2011 through Stanford University. Thrun has stated he hopes half
           a million students will enroll, after an enrollment of 160,000
           students in the predecessor course at Stanford, Introduction to
           Artificial Intelligence, and 90,000 students had enrolled in the
           initial two classes as of March 2012.Udacity was announced at the
           2012 Digital Life Design conference. Udacity is funded by venture
           capital firm, Charles River Ventures, and $200,000 of Thrun's
           personal money.
         </P>

         <P>
          The first two courses on Udacity started on 20 February 2012, entitled
          "CS 101: Building a Search Engine", taught by David Evans from the
          University of Virginia, and "CS 373: Programming a Robotic Car" taught
           by Thrun. Both courses use Python.

        <h2>CODE FORCES</h2>
        <P>
          Codeforces was created by a group of competitive programmers from
          Saratov State University led by Mike Mirzayanov. It was originally
          created for those interested in solving tasks and taking part in
          competitions. The first Codeforces Round was held on the February
          19, 2010 with 175 participants. As of the end of July 2019 over 650
          rounds were held, with over 9000 registered competitors per round on
          average. Before 2012 Codeforces Rounds were titled "Codeforces Beta
          Rounds" to indicate that the system was still under development.
        </P>

        <P>
          Codeforces is recommended by many universities. According to
          Daniel Sleator, professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon
          University, competitive programming is valuable in computer science
          education, because competitors learn to adapt classic algorithms to
          new problems, thereby improving their understanding of algorithmic
          concepts. He has used Codeforces problems in his class, 15-295:
          Competition Programming and Problem Solving.

        <h2>CODE CHEF</h2>
        <P>
          Code-Chef is an educational program and competitive programming
          community of programmers from across the globe. Code-Chef was
          started as an educational initiative in the year 2009 by Directi, an
          Indian software company.
        </p>
          <p>
            Apart from its monthly coding contests for the community, Code-Chef
            has many initiatives for schools, colleges and women in competitive
            programming. It is credited with hosting the India regionals of the
            ICPC for college students, as well as for IOI for school students in
            India. In 2020, its ownership was changed from Directi (founded by
            Bhavin Turakhia) to Unacademy (Gaurav Munjal, CEO).

            Most parts of Code-Chef are available without charge, but the more
             advanced features require a monthly subscription.
